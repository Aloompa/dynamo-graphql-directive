# @aloompa/dynamo-graphql-directive

This project is designed to expose Dynamo to the GraphQL as an ORM as detailed on [GraphQL Schema Directives as ORM](https://medium.com/brikl-engineering/graphql-schema-directives-as-orm-ec635fdc942d) by Tobias Meixner.

The idea is eventually be able to drive the entire backend through the schema without a need for handwriting any resolvers or mutations.

### Installation

With NPM:

`npm i @aloompa/dynamo-graphql-directive -S`

With Yarn:

`yarn add @aloompa/dynamo-graphql-directive --save`

### Getting Started

```js
import {ApolloServer} from 'apollo-server';
import {createDynamoSchema} from '@aloompa/dynamo-graphql-directive';
import {typeDefs} from './schema';

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers: {},
  schemaDirectives: {
    dynamo: createDynamoSchema({
      // Your custom AWS Dynamo config goes here
      endpoint: 'http://localhost:8000',
    }),
  },
});

server.listen().then(({url}) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€  Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

## Example Usage

### Scan an entire table

```gql
type Event {
  id: String
  name: String
}

type EventsCollection {
  items: [Event]
}

type Query {
  listEvents: EventsCollection @dynamo(table: "events")
}
```

### Get an item

```gql
type Event {
  id: String
  name: String
}

type Query {
  getEvent(id: String!): Event @dynamo(table: "events", action: "get")
}
```

### Query a table

**Coming Soon**, but I think it will look like:

```gql
type Event {
  id: String
  name: String
}

type EventsCollection {
  items: [Event]
}

type Query {
  listEventsByApp(query: String!): EventsCollection
    @dynamo(table: "events", action: "query", index: "appId-index")
}
```

### One to one relationships

```gql
type Place {
  id: String
  name: String
}

type Event {
  id: String
  name: String
  placeId: String
  place: Place @dynamo(table: "places", action: "get", foreignKey: "placeId")
}

type Query {
  getEvent(id: String!): Event @dynamo(table: "events", action: "get")
}
```

### One to many relationships

Coming Soon

### Many to many relationships

Coming Soon

### Create Item Mutations

```gql
type Event {
  id: String
  name: String
}

type EventMutationResponse {
  code: String
  message: String
  item: Event
}

type Mutation {
  createEvent(name: String): EventMutationResponse
    @dynamo(table: "events", action: "create")
}
```

### Update Item Mutations

```gql
type Event {
  id: String
  name: String
}

type EventMutationResponse {
  code: String
  message: String
  item: Event
}

type Mutation {
  updateEvent(id: String!, name: String): EventMutationResponse
    @dynamo(table: "events", action: "update")
}
```

### Destroy Item Mutation

```gql
type Event {
  id: String
  name: String
}

type EventMutationResponse {
  code: String
  message: String
  item: Event
}

type Mutation {
  destroyEvent(id: String!): EventMutationResponse
    @dynamo(table: "events", action: "destroy")
}
```
